`Knapsack Problem`
 
 - Knapsack means a bag.
 - Items with Price and Weight are given.
 - We have to fill the bag to get maximum profit.
 - Example:  
            -Given List of Weights: 3,2,4  
            -Given List of profits: 8,5,9  
            -Weight to be filled: 7  
            -Best possible combination with maximum profit: 4+3=7=Weight with Profit 9+8=17.  
 
 - Types of Knapsack:  
       - 0/1: Can't include an item multiple times.  
       - Bounded: Can include an item multiple times but with a limit.   
       - Unbounded: Can include an item multiple times with no limit.    
 
 - Types of Knapsack:  
       - Fractional: Can include a part of an item.  
       - Integer: Can't include a part of an item. 
 
 - Some Knapsack problems variations:  
       - Subset sum problem  
       - Partition equals subset problem  
       - Count of Subsets with particular sum.  
       - Partition of Set into 2 subsets such that difference of both the subsets should be minimum.  
       - Target Sum.  
   
 `Matrix Chain Multiplication`  
 
 - Given a List of Matrices.
 - Find the most efficient way to multiply the matrices together.
 - Find the efficient way such that we have minimum no of multiplications.
 - Various types of problems including strings,arrays etc.
