`Knapsack Problem`
 
 - Knapsack means a bag.
 - Items with Price and Weight are given.
 - We have to fill the bag to get maximum profit.
 - Example:  
            -Given List of Weights: 3,2,4  
            -Given List of profits: 8,5,9  
            -Weight to be filled: 7  
            -Best possible combination with maximum profit: 4+3=7=Weight with Profit 9+8=17.  
 
 - Types of Knapsack:  
       - 0/1: Can't include an item multiple times.  
       - Bounded: Can include an item multiple times but with a limit.   
       - Unbounded: Can include an item multiple times with no limit.    
 - Types of Knapsack:  
       - Fractional: Can include a part of an item.  
       - Integer: Can't include a part of an item.
